<h1>Prologue : The Biting Cold</h1>
<br>It was cold. 
<br>
<br>He couldn’t open his eyes and he barely felt anything.
<br>
<br>Anything but the freezing temperatures slowly seeping into his nightmares.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>He opened his eyes and everything was blurry. 
<br>
<br>There were two people standing in front of him, but he couldn’t recognize them. 
<br>
<br>He tried looking around but he wasn't in control. 
<br>
<br>The person on the left moved towards him, and he managed to see a familiar shape around his neck. 
<br>
<br>They were saying something to each other.
<br>
<br>He knew those voices.
<br>
<br>The one on the right reached to him. 
<br>
<br>He felt the hands soft and warm touch in his cheek and then darkness began to consume him with its cold grip.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>He could see more clearly now. 
<br>
<br>He was close to the ground.
<br>
<br>He felt so small.
<br>
<br>Like when he was a little boy.
<br>
<br>It was late in the day, cloudy and windy, and he was in a grassy field. 
<br>
<br>He was walking around happily when then someone shouted his name. 
<br>
<br>He looked back and there were two people standing there. 
<br>
<br>He could still not quite make out their features, but they were his parents. 
<br>
<br>Were they out of the village on a picnic ? 
<br>
<br>He didn't remember.
<br>
<br>His mother was walking slowly towards him with a precious smile on her face as she carried a basket. 
<br>
<br>The wind started picking up and she had to hold down on her hat and her dress, laughing happily and waving at  him.
<br>
<br>He waved back and could feel himself smiling too.
<br>
<br>Dad was there too, holding mommy’s hand and offering her help with the basket.
<br>
<br>She smiled and whispered something in his ear.
<br>
<br>A wicked smile appeared across his father’s face as he started sprinting towards him, laughing maniacally and with a wild look in his eyes. 
<br>
<br>He was massive.
<br>
<br>So strong.
<br>
<br>Ans so fast.
<br>
<br>It scared him.
<br>
<br>Utterly terrified he started running away as fast as he could, hearing the laughs of his father closing behind him.
<br>
<br>He wasn’t paying attention, but before he fell after tripping on a small rock he felt as he was lifted up by the sides as his father grabbed him and spun him around in the air, laughing.
<br>
<br>He started laughing too.

	Chapter: 1 Fields Of Memories
</h1>
<br>The train of thought stopped suddenly and he was enveloped in darkness again. 
<br>
<br>He could faintly hear the wind blowing and felt as though something like snow fell on top of him. 
<br>
<br>There was someone speaking, but he wasn’t able to hear what they said.
<br>
<br>-"Where’s mommy ? "-
<br>
<br>The sound of the wind was suddenly replaced by that of a storm. 
<br>
<br>He looked outside the window with hopeful eyes, waiting for his mother. 
<br>
<br>It was pouring outside. 
<br>
<br>The sky was cloudy and he could barely see a thing in the night’s dark grip.
<br>
<br>Not even the village’s lamps were doing their job. 
<br>
<br>It looked dangerous.
<br>
<br>He wondered if she was alright. 
<br>
<br>-"She will come late today."-
<br>
<br>He was playing with his food. 
<br>
<br>It was already pretty late so why would his mother come until later ?
<br>
<br>-"Why ? "-
<br>
<br>Lightning struck near their village and he scurried to hide behind his plate. 
<br>
<br>His father chuckled and rubbed his head. 
<br>
<br>There were suddenly three knocks on their door, and his father hurried over to open it. 
<br>
<br>He was scared of lightning, and the person outside, maybe it was a savage, but his eyes lit up as he realized who it was as he ran for the door.
<br>
<br>-"Mama !!! "-
<br>
<br>She hugged him tightly between her arms. 
<br>
<br>She was still wet from the storm and her maid uniform was soaked and her little boots covered in mud, but even so her hug felt so warm and nice. 
<br>
<br>His father approached her with a big smile and welcomed her back.
<br>
<br>-"You must change or you’ll get cold honey."-
<br>
<br>She nodded, blushing a little, loving how caring and affective he was as he carefully tried to dry off her hair and caressed her body.
<br>
<br>Her little baby also walked to her side and clung onto her leg, hugging it, making her smile and pat his little head.
<br>
<br>-"I can’t go back to the Town hall like this can I ? "-
<br>
<br>She smiled at him as he happily shook his head, agreeing with her as she playfully rubbed his hair. 
<br>
<br>He looked happy but thunder struck again and he scurried under the table with a scared face.
<br>
<br>"Again ? ", she mouthed at him. 
<br>
<br>Bran just shrugged as if saying “What can I do about it ? ”. 
<br>
<br>He was very gentle, loving and sweet, and he was an amazing husband.
<br>
<br>But when it came to kids he...well, and to be honest she too...they still had a lot to learn.
<br>
<br>-”Sweetheart.”-
<br>
<br>-”Please come out.”-
<br>
<br>He was a scaredly little boy but he came out crawling from his hiding place.
<br>
<br>-”Yes mommy ? ”-
<br>
<br>She kissed him on his little forehead and lifted him up, doing her best not to bring her too close as to get him wet too. 
<br>
<br>She really had gotten soaked from the storm outside, she just hoped she wouldn't catch a cold.
<br>
<br>Right now they really didn’t have the money for it.
<br>
<br>She would just have to suck it up and keep working hard for her family.
<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> She sat him on the chair and grabbed his cute little hand.
<br>
<br>-"Don’t be scared."-
<br>
<br>He made the cutest little face and seemed outraged that she wasn’t scared.
<br>
<br>-”But mama, it’s loud and bright and it could kill us.”-
<br>
<br>-”But isn’t my little boy here brave? ”-
<br>
<br>-”Promise me you won’t get scared of it again.”-
<br>
<br>Another thunder fell and though he closed his eyes tightly shut, he didn’t move or run away. 
<br>
<br>-”I’ll try.”-
<br>
<br>Well, at least he would try.
<br>
<br>-”That’s my brave little man right there.”-
<br>
<br>His father looked super proud of himself as he gave his son a hard tap on the back.
<br>
<br>Wait that looked a little too hard he almost sent her little baby flying away ?!?!
<br>
<br>-"Now go get you mom some clothes please kiddo."-
<br>
<br>Though their son didn’t seem to mind.
<br>
<br>Actually he was smiling.
<br>
<br>The darkness suddenly consumed his mind, the last thing he was able to see were the little wooden toys he had been playing with.
<br>
<br>A soft luscious voice spoke to him, it was very quiet, very delicate and fragile. 
<br>
<br>It was a woman’s voice.
<br>
<br>-"Help."-
<br>
<br>-”Someone.”-
<br>
<br>-”Anyone.”-
<br>
<br>-”Please.”-
<br>
<br>It sounded weak, and in pain.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>[“Shut up.”]
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>[“You’re not the only one.”]
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>["Wake up kid ! "]
<br>
<br>[“Reinhardt wake up ! ”]
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>The darkness disappeared as he continued to dream and remember.
<br>
<br>They were in the workshop of his father. 
<br>
<br>Just two years ago it had been given to him by the empire. 
<br>
<br>The Town hall had helped them out a lot and had built a small carpentry just for them because of their current need of refined wooden materials and furniture. 
<br>
<br>His father had gratefully accepted it, and not a day later was already working hard. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>He had gotten very good grades at school, so his father, knowing how intelligent his son was, took the time to explain in great detail how he made every single one of his works when he visited him in the afternoon. 
<br>
<br>It was very boring, especially after doing homework, but he knew it was important to his father so he listened, and sometimes he learned something new from different properties of different types of wood. 
<br>
<br>Daily he listened to his father talking about how oak was his favourite wood and so he had made all of their furniture and their house’s floors and walls with it. 
<br>
<br>But that he also loved cedars because of this and that and how birks were useless trees that only looked pretty, and how ebony and hickory were the best and strongest. 
<br>
<br>Or how cherry was the prettiest of them all objectively speaking. 
<br>
<br>He paid attention but in reality he didn’t much care.
<br>
<br>He adored how hard working his father was, but he didn’t want to become a craftsman himself.
<br>
<br>He wanted to become a soldier. 
<br>
<br>Even if he was only 9. 
<br>
<br>His parents were wholly against it, and said he would grow out of it, but he really admired the military ever since he was little. 
<br>
<br>He wanted to make them proud, and if he could give back a small part of everything that they had sacrificed for him he would. 
<br>
<br>A month ago, in school, he had learned that a soldier’s family received financial aid from the empire, and though he didn’t understand much of it, he knew that it would help them out and they would be grateful. 
<br>
<br>After all, working all day as a maid his mother had to be tired and his father having to work with his hands daily also had to hurt. 
<br>
<br>He just wanted to help the two people he loved most in this world. 
<br>
<br>But he would deal with these problems later though.
<br>
<br>He threw the small piece of paper he had been staring at to the side.
<br>
<br>“The military might of the empire needs more heroes. Recruiting soldiers for the glory of the empire.”
<br>
<br>His heart raced every time he read that line, but just for today he would allow himself to forget all about it and just be happy.
<br>
<br>Because today was his birthday !!!
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>They had been planning it now for a few weeks. 
<br>
<br>It would be nothing grandiose but they wanted to make his only 10 year birthday special. 
<br>
<br>At school, were he went in the mornings he only had two real friends, so they had, after asking the town hall for permission, invited them and their families to a small party. 
<br>
<br>At first he had been against it.
<br>
<br>He was a kid but he had grown up and matured a lot faster than most.
<br>
<br>He knew they didn’t have the money nor the time to make a party.
<br>
<br>But his parents had almost begged him to accept and after days of insisting he had conceded with a smile on his face. 
<br>
<br>Life was hard but the kid deserved to be happy.
<br>
<br>Dompy and Lonarc would come later that day, hopefully, and their parents too. 
<br>
<br>He was sad he didn’t have any other family other than his parents to invite.
<br>
<br>He would like to know who his grandparents were.
<br>
<br>Maybe he had cousins somewhere, who knew ?
<br>
<br>Apparently his parents had moved to this village alone to get a better life and had lost their relatives whereabouts. 
<br>
<br>Something about his mother leaving her family after marrying his father and a big fight between her family and something about an inheritance.
<br>
<br>But meh. 
<br>
<br>Who cared now ? 
<br>
<br>His parents and friends loved him enough so he didn’t need anything more.
<br>
<br>He was happy.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>With his father’s relatively new workshop they could afford the party, and both of them had worked a few longer shifts to adjust for it. 
<br>
<br>It was midday and the three of them had gone out together to the village’s market. 
<br>
<br>The bustling streets full of curious people, and the small markets brimming with life.
<br>
<br>His mother would cook dinner which always made him hopeful and happy. 
<br>
<br>He had always thought of how she always managed to make food be so tasty, and some days he stood by her side watching and following every one of her movements as she prepared her delicious meals. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>His father had a big dumb smile on his face as he was carrying along the groceries bsck home. 
<br>
<br>He was glad to be able to buy it with their hard earned money. 
<br>
<br>Happy, to be able to give his son a party.
<br>
<br>Reinhardt was still very small, but they had gone through a lot, and even if he didn’t understand a lot of things yet, he felt pride and respect for the hard work both of his parents did. 
<br>
<br>His mother had worked as a maid for 12 years now and his father had been a craftsman since he had become 13, so a very, very long time ago. 
<br>
<br>Difficult jobs that took out a lot from a person.
<br>
<br>Their bodies hurt and they were always tired.
<br>
<br>But they somehow always came back home with a smile and gave each other and him a big hug.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>They returned an hour later after shopping and happily wandering around the village, and she started cooking. 
<br>
<br>They were only three families, and each four people at most, so it wasn’t quantity that she had to take care of but rather quality. 
<br>
<br>After all, it was the tenth birthday of her precious little child.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>She had been working overtime to compensate for the food they would have to buy for dinner.
<br>
<br>Just earlier in the morning she had left the town hall after thirty straight hours of work.
<br>
<br>Her body was devastated to say the least, but for her little kid she could keep going.
<br>
<br>Cleaning windows, floors, washing clothes. Cleaning toilets, sowing clothes, tidying rooms, doing errands. Making food and serving it to the few nobles there were. Having to always smile despite their rude and forceful commentaries and doing her job to the best of her abilities. 
<br>
<br>She was tired.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Bran stood by her side, wanting so much to help but with a gloomy expression, knowing his food was abhorrent.
<br>
<br>And so was little Reinhardt too to her other side, staring intensely as she worked and chopped potatoes.
<br>
<br>Turning the potato around while holding the knife still, peeling off the skin, and then very skillfully dicing it into tiny little chunks.
<br>
<br>Reinhardt’s eyes were glimmering as he saw how fast she chopped the brownish vegetables.
<br>
<br>She looked at Bran with that cute expression and he nodded.
<br>
<br>Her husband grabbed a chair and put Reinhardt on top.
<br>
<br>She gave the little kid another knife and a potato, a little scared to give him the sharp thing, but trusting in her husband would watch over and protect them form anything going wrong.
<br>
<br>Just like he always did.
<br>
<br>And she was so happy to see how he slowly copied her movements.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>This he could do !!!
<br>
<br>He was a skilled craftsman so cutting vegetables should be childsplay.
<br>
<br>He softly reached down, grabbed her tightly and squished her bottom, seeing how she jumped a little and then laughed, blushing.
<br>
<br>Fine fine.
<br>
<br>She wanted this to be part of her gift to her little boy...but cooking, well...chopping and dicing food in family sounded like a really nice thing, so she handed her teaseful husband another knife and a few potatoes.
<br>
<br>It really did feel nice to cook with the two of them.
<br>
<br>Her heart felt so warm as she kept happily cooking together with her protective and loving husband and her sweet little boy.
<br>
<br>They should do this a lot more often.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Four hours had passed and nobody had arrived yet. 
<br>
<br>Later he learned that Dompy and his family had to go on a sudden trip to a nearby village after hearing some family members had passed away,and Lonarc had gotten sick and didn’t want anyone else to get sick too, so he had stayed home. 
<br>
<br>His parents had had a sad look but he managed to cheer them up eating wildly and with a big smile on his face. 
<br>
<br>He didn’t really care if his friends hadn’t been able to come, well, he did, but his father and his mother were with him and that’s all that mattered now. 
<br>
<br>With a big smile on his cute little face he took a spoonful of cake, covering his whole mouth and nose in the delicious dessert they had all made together, thanking both of them and laughing a little as they hugged him. 
<br>
<br>Everything suddenly went dark again.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>She was crying, very weakly.
<br>
<br>It was the same voice.
<br>
<br>-"Please don’t leave me alone."-
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Everyone was alone in this world.
<br>
<br>[“Stop crying you idiot.”]
<br>
<br>She just had to kill herself.
<br>
<br>Just like he would if he woke up from this nightmare.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Why was he still remembering ?
<br>
<br>Stop. 
<br>
<br>Stop.
<br>
<br>Stop.
<br>
<br>Stop.
<br>
<br>[“Please don’t remember that day.”]
<br>
<br>He had suffered enough already.
<br>
<br>Why did this world hate him so much ?
<br>
<br>Why did he have to remember now ?
<br>
<br>Why ?
<br>
<br>Why ?
<br>
<br>Why ?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Just recently he had become 12, and was already old enough to join the military. 
<br>
<br>He had never left that dream, that promise to give his family a better life, and yet his parents were still against it. 
<br>
<br>They had had a fight recently where they argued, badly.
<br>
<br>That they hadn’t worked so hard and gone through so much suffering just to have their son’s death arrive in a letter. 
<br>
<br>It was his fault they were this worried. 
<br>
<br>He never mentioned that he wanted to do it for them and that it would benefit them if he became a soldier, and even if he was to die the empire would still pay them for a few years for having had a close family member fight in the front lines. 
<br>
<br>He guessed they knew why he did it.
<br>
<br>So why didn’t they let him help them ?
<br>
<br>School had finished a year ago and his only options were working with his father, searching for another job or betray their trust and become a soldier. 
<br>
<br>He didn’t want to disappoint them. 
<br>
<br>He owed them so much and he loved them to no end so he didn’t want to hurt them. 
<br>
<br>He still had a few days to think about it before he took the decision. 
<br>
<br>He just wanted to make them happy, even if they said he should search for his own happiness.
<br>
<br>He would be happy if they were happy.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Ooop.
<br>
<br>He almost tripped on a small rock, losing his balance and returning to reality.
<br>
<br>The town was still bustling with life, though to him it felt a little more dead and boring.
<br>
<br>Maybe because his only friends had left.
<br>
<br>He remembered that the last time he saw them both was before his tenth birthday.
<br>
<br>Ah...
<br>
<br>And he also remembered walking down this same street to buy groceries with his parents.
<br>
<br>Today they had given him money to go buy the groceries for the week, just as any other day. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>The village was big but he knew in comparison they were tiny. 
<br>
<br>It was only 700 meters wide and had around 2100 buildings which made everything close in proximity, so he didn’t have to walk that long before he was already in the market. 
<br>
<br>The town hall was the only building made of pure concrete, and it stood tall among the other buildings, able to be seen from every alley in the village. 
<br>
<br>He was heading to a shop that sold low-quality metal for a few cheap chairs his father was making. 
<br>
<br>He took any job that came his way. 
<br>
<br>He was a pushover but in a way that’s who his father was and like his mother, he had learned to accept it. 
<br>
<br>The village had small walls, but at the very least they were made of bricks, rather than wood and straw as some other smaller and more unlucky villages. 
<br>
<br>And their houses were of wood.
<br>
<br>Cheap, since they lived to the side of a forest but there had been a few accidents with fire.
<br>
<br>But they were lucky with that too since there was a river that crossed the little village.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Midway to the shop he noticed some soldiers in a rush. 
<br>
<br>Why did they look so anxious ? 
<br>
<br>He decided to ignore them.
<br>
<br>The old woman from the fruit shop waved at him, smiling.
<br>
<br>He approached her with the intent to buy some of the delicious apples she sold, but he stopped himself, waved back and kept walking.
<br>
<br>The money wasn’t for that.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>He noticed even more soldiers running to the small lookout towers.
<br>
<br>What was happening seriously ?
<br>
<br>The market was close to the south gate.
<br>
<br>The south...were the savages lived.
<br>
<br>He ran to the gate and saw an entire battalion of soldiers had gathered there and had closed the gates.
<br>
<br>He squeezed between the crowd that had formed around the place.
<br>
<br>Was there going to be a demonstration ?!?!
<br>
<br>He was suddenly excited and without a care in the world went scurrying past the soldiers.
<br>
<br>His eyes were glimmering and he was so giddy he didn’t notice the soldiers’s expressions.
<br>
<br>Nobody even paid attention to him as he walked in front of them, just to see that there was nothing.
<br>
<br>They were all in formation and with weapons drawn, looking outside.
<br>
<br>The village was close to a forest that divided north from south, so when he reached the gate he couldn’t see far away.
<br>
<br>There was nothing alarming so why were they so serious ?
<br>
<br>Maybe it was part of the demonstration ? 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>The savages never came near their village since it was surprisingly well protected and completely unimportant. 
<br>
<br>Surrounded by a forest and a river it would be difficult for a big sized army to attack, they had nothing valuable here, and furthermore they had their own military compound which was a rarity for a village their size. 
<br>
<br>In school they taught him that there were 12 cities, 14, smaller towns and 49 villages. Their village was near the border that separated the Empire from the demi humans, which meant they were in a high risk area.
<br>
<br>And yet never in his 12 years of life he had ever seen a single savage outside of the school books illustrations.
<br>
<br>Which made him shake to the bone when through the wall’s gate, near the forest, in a bush, he saw two yellow glowing eyes, staring at him.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>The same voice. Even quieter than before. It was getting weaker and weaker.
<br>
<br>-"I can’t… not anymore. Someone, please."-
<br>
<br>Everything went dark once more except this time he could see the glowing sick yellow eyes in front of him. 
<br>
<br>Everything started flashing white and yellow, but those eyes never went away. 
<br>
<br>They just kept staring at him. 
<br>
<br>Laughing at him.
<br>
<br>No no no no no no no no.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>He fell to his knees and looked behind him when he heard a laughing growl. 
<br>
<br>There were seven people on the ground, covered in blood. 
<br>
<br>Why did he have to remember it now ? 
<br>
<br>Why were the nightmares coming back ?
<br>
<br>Why did it have to happen again ?
<br>
<br>Why had history repeated itself ?
<br>
<br>His friends.
<br>
<br>His family.
<br>
<br>No !
<br>
<br>So much pain.
<br>
<br>So much suffering. 
<br>
<br>He wanted it all to end.
<br>
<br>Why couldn’t he just die ?!?!?!
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>A bell started ringing in the distance, followed moments later by a few more all around the town, all of them alerting them of the coming danger. 
<br>
<br>His vision and sense of self returned in an instant and he was back in the village. 
<br>
<br>He was running away.
<br>
<br>It was standard procedure for all citizens to flee to the town hall in case of an emergency, but he was heading the other way. 
<br>
<br>Turning around a corner into an empty alleyway to cut time he sped up and frantically ran towards his home. 
<br>
<br>Both of his parents had been there today.
<br>
<br>He had to find them and get back to the town hall as quickly as possible together. 
<br>
<br>He desperately searched for them for a few minutes, almost falling to the ground as the crowds bumped into him and they ran away.
<br>
<br>There were so many noises, so many screams and people running.
<br>
<br>He heard an explosion and saw clouds of black smoke rising from the south gate.
<br>
<br>But even among that chaos he managed to hear their voice, screaming and calling for him.
<br>
<br>-"Thank God you are alive sweetheart."-
<br>
<br>His mother hugged him and his father started crying but he just ignored them and grabbed both of their hands taking them through the alleyways.
<br>
<br>-"Where are you taking us son ? "-
<br>
<br>They should be going with everyone else, though the main street.
<br>
<br>Where was their son taking them ?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>He was panting already for running so carelessly before, but they had to keep going.
<br>
<br>-"The alleys. We’re less likely to run into anything there."-
<br>
<br>He just wanted to keep them safe, so he had chosen both the fastest path and safest route.
<br>
<br>The only downside is that it was difficult to move in some cramped areas and not a lot of people could fit. 
<br>
<br>Good thing was that only Reinhardt and his past friends had ever known about this path since they had studied it many times for fun.
<br>
<br>Jumping on roofs and hiding around the small alleys when they did pranks on people.
<br>
<br>And now all of that "wasted" time would prove useful. 
<br>
<br>Maybe it would even save their lives.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>There were many turns and tight spaces but they were still able to go very quickly. 
<br>
<br>He was leading the way, running very fast when he heard noises behind him and had to stop.
<br>
<br>-"Wait up ! "-
<br>
<br>His father got closer to his mother who was bent over and coughing badly.
<br>
<br>-"Honey are you all right ? "-
<br>
<br>She raised her hand but started vomiting as she tried to speak.
<br>
<br>He hugged her and moved her hair out of the way.
<br>
<br>-"There you go, don’t worry sweethea..."-
<br>
<br>-"Dad what’s going on !? "-
<br>
<br>His father seemed anxious and flustered, what was happening?
<br>
<br>-"We’ll rest for a bit."-
<br>
<br>Reinhardt wasn’t going to give up so he kept insisting.
<br>
<br>-"Dad we have to go ! "-
<br>
<br>His father gritted his teeth and reluctantly answered.
<br>
<br>-"She can’t run."-
<br>
<br>-"Why ? "-
<br>
<br>His mother regained her composure and answered him.
<br>
<br>-"We wanted to wait a little longer to tell you..."-
<br>
<br>She vomited again and his father continued for her.
<br>
<br>-"Your mother is pregnant."-
<br>
<br>-"What !? "-
<br>
<br>It had to be a joke.
<br>
<br>It had to.
<br>
<br>Why now ?
<br>
<br>Did the world hat him so much ?
<br>
<br>Did God hate him so much ?
<br>
<br>He was going to have a little sister ?! 
<br>
<br>Or a brother ?!
<br>
<br>Why did they have to tell him now ? 
<br>
<br>Why did this have to happen today of all days ? 
<br>
<br>They had to go to the Town hall if they wanted to be safe. 
<br>
<br>They had to...they had to...they had to.
<br>
<br>-"Dad, we have to go."-
<br>
<br>-"You go, we have to stay."-
<br>
<br>If they stayed here they would die.
<br>
<br>He wanted to go and drag them along with him if it was necessary, but before he had the chance, the walls surrounding them exploded and everything disappeared from view.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>His eyes hurt because of the small dust particles, but he still tried to open them. 
<br>
<br>The air started to clear slowly and he could see his mother lying on the ground, coughing and in the brink of vomiting. 
<br>
<br>His father was nowhere to be seen. 
<br>
<br>The collapsed walls were difficult to climb over and the roof from the house that had exploded looked like it could collapse any second. 
<br>
<br>Just as he was about to try to help her up the ground behind him rumbled and out of the hole of in the wall came a bull looking creature.
<br>
<br>Standing two and a half meters tall he saw into its eyes, the same yellow eyes as before. 
<br>
<br>The same eyes that would ruin his life.
<br>
<br>All of his family was gone.
<br>
<br>Because of them.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>He noticed there was a soldier on the ground, dead with two gaping gory wounds in his abdomen. 
<br>
<br>He wanted to throw up.
<br>
<br>He grabbed the soldier’s sword and held it between them. 
<br>
<br>His mother was still on the ground, coughing and vomiting, and the only thing standing between her and the beast was him. 
<br>
<br>He started to swing it and try to take the beast down, but the savage only stood there looking at him. 
<br>
<br>It blocked the attacks with its battle axe but it didn’t make any attempt to attack him. 
<br>
<br>Was he really so useless as to be ignored ? 
<br>
<br>Was he so laughable and petty ?
<br>
<br>Why couldn’t he do the only thing he wanted to ?
<br>
<br>Why could he never protect his family ?
<br>
<br>Everything went dark once more.
<br>
<br>The last thing he remembered were the pained screams of his mother as he felt a sharp pain on his head.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>He woke up in a tan colored room. 
<br>
<br>He had his head covered in bandages, but he didn’t feel anything off. 
<br>
<br>Sitting up he felt his head spin for a few seconds, realizing there were a lot of wounded people around him. 
<br>
<br>Getting back on his feet he noticed how there were no more bells ringing. 
<br>
<br>There wasn’t any sound at all.
<br>
<br>Everything had settled down and there was no more threat. 
<br>
<br>Had they won ? 
<br>
<br>Remembering what had just happened, he just got up, taking off his bandages and going outside. 
<br>
<br>Someone was screaming as he exited the tent and told him to go back, but he didn’t listen. 
<br>
<br>He wasn’t wounded, but more importantly, he had to know that he had dreamed what had just happened. 
<br>
<br>Where were his mother and father ? 
<br>
<br>His little sibling ? 
<br>
<br>Were they all right ? 
<br>
<br>He had to run. 
<br>
<br>He had to find them. 
<br>
<br>They had to be safe. 
<br>
<br>They had to.
<br>
<br>They had to.
<br>
<br>They just had to.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>There were so many dead bodies.
<br>
<br>People torn in half.
<br>
<br>Gore all over the place.
<br>
<br>He wanted to vomit.
<br>
<br>The village was covered in a crimson glow.
<br>
<br>Was everyone else dead ?
<br>
<br>We...
<br>
<br>Were his pare...
<br>
<br>Were they dead too ?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>He could barely spot even a single savage corpse, only seas of dead humans.
<br>
<br>Had they really lost so many ? 
<br>
<br>Had they even won ?
<br>
<br>Why ?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>When he finally reached the alley where they had been he saw how the soldier that had been on the ground had completely bled out. 
<br>
<br>His eyes were rolled back and all of his organs were spilled on the ground.
<br>
<br>He wanted to vomit.
<br>
<br>No.
<br>
<br>Please no.
<br>
<br>Where his mother had previously been, there was only a bloody spot on the ground.
<br>
<br>He got closer and fell to his knees.
<br>
<br>There were a few bones and chunks of flesh covered in blood
<br>
<br>No no no no no no.
<br>
<br>Maybe she was with his father !
<br>
<br>That’s right she was with him !!!
<br>
<br>Where was his father ?!?!?!
<br>
<br>-”Dad ?!? ”-
<br>
<br>-”DAD ?!!! ”-
<br>
<br>No no no no no.
<br>
<br>His legs were moving on their own. 
<br>
<br>Slowly being dragged through the rubble.
<br>
<br>There was another pile of flesh on the ground.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Why was t...why was it here ?
<br>
<br>He couldn’t...why ?
<br>
<br>His father was nowhere to be seen, and his mother had vanished.
<br>
<br>What was happening ?
<br>
<br>Why were their clothes and necklaces lying on the ground ?
<br>
<br>The fabrics had been torn by claws and teeth.
<br>
<br>Ripped apart violently.
<br>
<br>Their shoes too.
<br>
<br>And they were soaked in blood.
<br>
<br>Had the...
<br>
<br>Had the savages...
<br>
<br>Eaten them ?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>I’ve Lost Everything
<br>
<br>He couldn’t...
<br>
<br>His vision went hazy and his head was spinning.
<br>
<br>He couldn’t...
<br>
<br>His entire body gave out and he started vomiting.
<br>
<br>His parents...both of them...
<br>
<br>Gone.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>He could never even say goodbye.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-”Mommy...? ”-
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-”Daddy...? ”-
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-”Please...”-
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>-”Please don’t...”-
<br>
<br>
<br>-”Don’t leave me alone.”-
